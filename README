# Dataflow Analysis In Zig

This is a repo for a ACT class homework in PKU. The goal is to implement *Reaching Definitions*, *Available Expressions* and *Live Variables* DFA (Data Flow Analysis).

## Running the code
1. Install [zig](https://ziglang.org/)
2. Clone the repo
3. Run the following commands: `zig build run`

It will generate 3 files, containing the Control Flow Graph of a (hardcoded) program with nodes labeled by the corresponding DFA sets.
